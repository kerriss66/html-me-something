            <h2>Myrtle Beach, SC</h2>
            <p>I have family living in Charleston, SC. In 2017, I decided to use my timeshare points and visit family. Myrtle Beach is about 2 hours North of Charleston - close enough to extended family, but far enough away to enjoy time with my kids at the beach. Myrtle Beach is a beautiful and friendly vacation location. I will be returning again next summer, 2020.
            </p>

                <h2>New Orleans, LA</h2>
                <p>My son-in-law is in the U.S. Navy. From 2012 to 2016, my daughter, son-in-law, and grandchildren lived in Belle Chase, LA (about 15 miles from New Orleans). I made trips at least twice a year to visit and fell in love with the city and area. The people are welcoming and the weather is nice all year long. My daughter and family hope to be stationed there again next year, 2020, until the end of my son-in-law's enlistment.

                <h2>Panama City Beach, FL</h2>
                <p>In 2016, After visiting my daughter and her family in Louisiana, I wanted to extend our vacation. We drove East along the Gulf Coast and spent three days in Panama City Beach, FL. It is absolutely breathtaking. The water is quite warm and inviting. Three days was definitly not enough. It is a popular destination and I have been unable to use my timeshare points to book another vacation. I hope to return there in the next few years.

                    <h2>New Jersey</h2>
                    <p>My daughter and her family are currently stationed at the Joint Base - McGuire, Dix, Lakehurst in New Jersey. I have visited once and will be returning this Christmas. It is much nicer than I had expected. It is very green and not far from a beach. The water is cold and I have not been able to test it out yet. They are hoping to return to Louisiana next year, so I may never be able to check out the beach there. I'm okay with that. I prefer Louisiana.

                    <h2>Philadelphia, PA</h2>
                    <p>While my daughter and family are in New Jersey, we took a day trip to Philadelphia, PA. We mostly visited the historic area around the Liberty Bell. It was a beautiful area and I would like to return and visit more of the historic sites.

                    <p>My son, his wife, and daughter live in Columbus, OH. It is about an eight hour drive from my home to his. I go as often as I can since they have recently added a new family member, my granddaughter. I will be visiting again over Thanksgiving this year.
